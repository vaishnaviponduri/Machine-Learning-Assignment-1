This project implements linear regression from scratch on synthetic data (y = 3 + 4x + noise) and compares two approaches to estimate parameters:

Closed-form solution (Normal Equation) – exact least-squares solution.

Batch Gradient Descent – iterative optimization using MSE minimization.

# Highlights:

Gradient Descent converges to values very close to the closed-form solution.

Loss curve shows rapid decrease and flattening, confirming convergence.

Visual comparison of fitted lines demonstrates agreement between the two methods.
